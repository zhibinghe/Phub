Title: modified EM algorithm for Penalized Hub Model
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Zhibing He 
Maintainer: Zhibing He <zhibingh@asu.edu>
Description: A regularization approach to hub set selection in hub models by shrinking the components weight.
             Additionally, the package can deal with estimation for all hub models and the variants: 
             Asymmetric Hub Mode, Hub Model with the null component, Hub Model with unknown hub set.
             For details of hub models, see the paper 'Network Inference Using the Hub Model and Variants'.
