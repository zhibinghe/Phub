# R package Phub: A Regularization Approach to Component Selection in Hub Models for Network Inference

The package provides the algorithms of estimations for a series of hub models, and hub set selection approach for the hub model when hub set is unknown.
For details of hub models, see the paper 'Network Inference Using the Hub Models and Variants'. An earlier version of the paper is available from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09709.pdf.
